# Peas on Earth 

## Description 
This project maps Seattle's P-Patch community gardens alongside the city's light rail network to help residents more easily locate accessible, local, and nutritious food options. In a city where transit access and healthy food availability vary widely by neighborhood, this tool aims to bridge the gap by visualizing how close community members are to fresh produce grown in their own communities.

## Project Goal
Beyond producing a useful interactive map, the project also explores broader questions about food equity, transit connectivity, and the role of community gardens in supporting sustainable, community-driven food systems. Many Seattle residents, especially those in transit-dependent or under-resourced neighborhoods, face structural barriers to reaching affordable, healthy food.

By making this spatial information easy to explore, the project supports residents, planners, and community advocates in identifying gaps, proposing interventions, and celebrating the areas where local food access is already thriving.
